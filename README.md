This is a recreational Ray Tracing Project based off of a [Walnut](https://github.com/TheCherno/Walnut) template, using the [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) textbook.  See the [Walnut](https://github.com/TheCherno/Walnut) repository for more details.
